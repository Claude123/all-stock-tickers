# all-stock-tickers
This is a git with all the stock tickers I could find the way they appear in yahoo finance.
It's useful if you are writing a custom made stock screener using yfinance api.
As you can probably guess the echange code is part of the file name. 
If you find any missing tickers feel free to add them via pull request.
Good luck and have fun.
